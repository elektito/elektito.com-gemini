# Meet Hodhod Gemini Server

So I finally have a working version of my Gemini server which is now called Hodhod. You can find the source code here:

=> https://github.com/elektito/hodhod Hodhod on Github

These are the design goals I had in mind, when writing Hodhod:

 - Pretty URLs: You can opt out of file extensions, and you can mount your paths wherever you want in the URL-space.
 - Multiple capsule support
 - CGI support: Because I want to serve my Gemini search engine using this same server.

Hodhod is already serving this capsule. I've created a stub home page for the project here:

=> /hodhod Hodhod

I hope I'll be able to write full configuration docs on that page in the future.
